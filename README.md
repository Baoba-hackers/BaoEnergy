## 📜 Description

BaoEnergy proposes an innovative blockchain solution to reshape access to the Free Energy Market (FEM) in Brazil. Our approach aims to simplify the entry of consumers and companies into this market by offering a decentralized platform that allows direct negotiation between energy consumers and suppliers, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs.
