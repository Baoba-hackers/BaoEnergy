## <a name="c1"></a>1. Introduction

### 2.1 Objectives

### 2.2 Justification
&emsp;The implementation of this project is based on the pressing market need for transparency in the prices of indirect inputs, with the clear aim of achieving fair prices and mitigating the risks associated with corruption. The purchase of indirect inputs represents a critical activity for the success of any organization, whether public or private, however, this process often proves to be opaque and susceptible to corrupt practices.

&emsp;Excessive payments are one of the most direct consequences of this lack of transparency, where companies may inadvertently expend amounts exceeding the fair value of inputs, harming their financial results and undermining their competitiveness. Additionally, pressure to reduce costs often leads to the acquisition of lower quality inputs, consequently compromising the quality of the final products or services offered by the organization.

&emsp;A recent study conducted by the Federal Court of Audit (TCU) revealed that, between 2010 and 2020, the federal government incurred significant losses totaling R$ 100 billion due to fraud in tenders for the purchase of indirect inputs [1]. This alarming figure underscores the urgent need for effective measures to combat corruption in this sector and ensure more transparent and efficient management of public and private resources.

&emsp;In this context, transparency emerges as a fundamental pillar to ensure equity and effectiveness in the acquisition of indirect inputs. By making crucial information such as prices, suppliers, and purchasing processes public, it is possible to promote healthy competition among suppliers, fostering price reduction and ensuring the quality of the acquired inputs. Furthermore, transparency hampers practices favoring specific companies and the occurrence of corrupt acts, contributing to a more integrous and fair business environment.

&emsp;Thus, the construction of the proposed solution presents itself not only as an effective response to the challenges faced in the context of the purchase of indirect inputs but also as a fundamental step in promoting transparency, equity, and efficiency in commercial practices, both in the public and private sectors.
