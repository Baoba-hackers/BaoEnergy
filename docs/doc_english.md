During the creation of this project, technologies such as Scaffold from BuildGuild, Scroll, and Chainlink were utilized. Scaffold was used to facilitate the integration of smart contracts with the front-end. Upon deploying the Smart Contract, this tool generates functions capable of connecting it to a front-end also automatically created. Furthermore, to enhance the user experience, the front-end generated by Scaffold was refactored to make it more consistent and suitable for what our solution aims to offer to the user as an experience.

Regarding Chainlink, its functions were used to obtain and monitor the electricity meter data used by customers. This way, they can gauge their energy consumption to ensure they will be paying fair and proportional prices for their usage.

With the Scroll tool, the main objective is to execute heavier operations on its Layer 2, which would require high gas levels on the Ethereum network. Thus, we could perform necessary tasks while reducing the cost for doing so. For this reason, we will deploy a smart contract on the Scroll network. However, at the moment, creating the bridge, which acts as a connection between Layers 1 and 2, has proven to be difficult, bringing issues that not even the network developers have been able to resolve.
